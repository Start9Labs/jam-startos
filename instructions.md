## About JoinMarket

JoinMarket is software to create a special kind of bitcoin transaction called a CoinJoin transaction. Its aim is to improve the confidentiality and privacy of bitcoin transactions.
A CoinJoin transaction requires other people to take part. The right resources (coins) have to be in the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity. This isn't a software or tech problem, it's an economic problem. JoinMarket works by creating a new kind of market that would allocate these resources in the best way.

For a quick introduction to Joinmarket you can watch [this demonstration](https://youtu.be/hwmvZVQ4C4M) of installation and usage given by [Adam Gibson](https://github.com/AdamISZ) during the [Understanding Bitcoin conference](https://understandingbtc.com/) on April 6 2019.
